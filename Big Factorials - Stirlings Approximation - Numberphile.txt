Large factorials and the use of Stirling's Approximation. Featuring Professor Ken McLaughlin.


      infinity
N! = Integral  X^N e^-X dx
      x = 0

Stirlings Approximation
N! ~ N^N e^-N SQRT(N) SQRT(2Pi)

N! / Stirlings  --> 0 as N approaches infinity.

Accuracy increases for large N.

The difference between N! and Stirlings increases as N increases.
But the ratio - the error - decreases.

Much easier / quicker to calculate Stirlings Approximation for large N
than it is to calcuate the exact N! using big integers.


Levent
For those we are still confused about the part where their ratio gets closer to one while their difference increases, think about it like this: 1 and 2 have a ratio of 0.5 and a difference of one. 900 and 1000 have a ratio of 0.9, which is closer to 1, but a difference of 100, which is much larger.
